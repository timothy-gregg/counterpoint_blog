Even by the standards of modern Australian politics, last week's leadership coup was especially self-destructive. The Liberal party managed to terminate its two most popular figures, Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop, and torpedo any lingering prospect of winning the next federal election. 


Of course, this coup had nothing to do with electoral prospects. Revenge, purifying the party, etc. 

Appreciate how much damage the conservatives were willing to inflict on their own party and colleagues, look at data compared to other coups
