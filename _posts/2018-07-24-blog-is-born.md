title: "A blog is born"

After a bit of fiddling, I’ve got my new blog up and running. This site will serve as a clearing house for my journalism, research, and weird philosophical musings. Mostly I’ll be exploring Australian politics through an analytical lens. 

I called the site Counterpoint because I hope it will provide a unique perspective on current affairs. I’m inspired by sites like FiveThirtyEight and the Guardian Datablog. I think we need more data journalism in the Australian conversation. 
 
Data journalism?
--- 
I agree that it’s a bit of a lame buzzword. But I can’t think of a snappier description for what I’m trying to achieve. I’m interested in using computational tools to uncover stories that are worth writing and reading. 

Many moons ago, I studied journalism at the University of Queensland. I’ve worked on-and-off as a freelance journo for the past decade. But only recently have I become interested in computer science. I’ve begun to appreciate the immense power and creative potential that programming brings to the craft of storytelling. 

I’m very much a journalist first, programmer second. If you’re looking for any sort of reliable advice on coding, you’re in the wrong place. But I’ll publish what I learn anyway. Maybe someone will find it useful. I’ll also make the code and data for my stories available on GitHub.   


My tech stack

For data analysis, my weapon of choice is the Python programming language. I’m still pretty bad at using it, but I get a bit better every day. I’m also learning to use R for statistical stuff. 

This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. Until recently I used WordPress for all my web projects. This time around, I decided to try a different approach. 

Jekyll requires a bit more technical competence than WordPress, but it’s well worth the effort. I love the simplicity and purity of a static site generator. There’s no database. Nothing to update or maintain. I can simply write a blog post, save it as a Markdown file, and hey presto: it’s published. 

I’m writing this blog as a side project in my spare time, so you can expect updates to be infrequent and irregular. I’ll get a mailing list going at some point. 

Until then, thanks for reading.
