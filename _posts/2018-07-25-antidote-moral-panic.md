title: The antidote to moral panic
---

I'm yet to read Steven Pinker's new book, _Enlightenment Now_, but it's on my list. In the meantime, I'm watching his recent talks on YouTube. [This is a good one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDAoEyrvf8Y){:target="_blank"}.

I don't agree with everything Pinker says, but he makes some salient observations, especially about the news media. Journalists tend to report what goes wrong in the world while ignoring most of the things that go right. As a consequence, we get the impression that civilisation is falling apart, when in fact things have never been better. 

In Australia, our current obsession with an "African crime wave" is a good example of the disconnect between perception and reality. Since the issue of Melbourne's Sudanese youth gangs first got traction in the media in late 2017, it has exploded into the public consciousness and become a _cause célèbre_ for some of our less enlightened politicians. 

This chart from Google Trends shows you how often Australians searched for the term "African crime" in 2017. Notice the rather large spike at the end of the year.

The funny thing is, despite the huge attention this issue has received, the issue itself is virtually non-existent. In Victoria,  [roughly 1% of alleged offenders](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-17/what-statistics-tell-us-about-melbournes-african-crime-issue/9336604){:target="_blank"} are Sudanese immigrants. 

It's true that they are overrepresented in the crime statistics, relative to the size of their population, but there are [many complex reasons](https://ketanjoshi.co/2018/07/15/were-a-little-closer-to-the-violent-destination-of-victorias-racist-campaign/){:target="_blank"} for this disparity. It's not the straightforward indictment many people make it out to be. 

In any case, no matter how overrepresented Sudanese criminals may be, they still account for a tiny fraction of the criminal population. The amount of time and energy we spend talking about this issue is grossly disproportionate to the issue itself.     

There's a familiar pattern here. The media picks up on a handful of isolated incidents and gives them front-page coverage. Moral panic ensues. More media coverage follows because it's what people want to read. Then the politicians start talking about it, which generates even more media coverage, and we're off to the races. 

Some Sudanese kids trash a house in Melbourne, and suddenly we're in the grips of an African crime wave. A couple of people die in bar brawls in Sydney, and suddenly we face an epidemic of alcohol-fuelled violence. 

Never mind the fact that your house is far more likely to be trashed by Australian kids. Never mind the fact that both violence and alcohol consumption are at historically low levels. ([I wrote about this](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/australia-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-alcohol-we-have-a-problem-with-violence-20150120-12u3eb.html){:target="_blank"} in the _Sydney Morning Herald_ back in 2015, at the height of our coward-punch hysteria.) 

I don't mean to disrespect the people who fall victim to these crimes or to diminish their suffering. I'm simply pointing out that these people are, thankfully, a tiny minority. These incidents are rare, which is precisely why they shock us. If they happened every day, we wouldn't even notice. 

This is an important fact, but one that we tend to forget. The amount of media coverage an issue receives rarely correlates with the frequency or severity of the issue. Most reporting focuses on the exception to the rule without even acknowledging that the rule exists.

All the more reason, I reckon, to embrace a data-driven model of journalism. Reporting that's grounded in statistical context can be a powerful antitode to our subjective delusions.
