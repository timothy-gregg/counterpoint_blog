The antidote to moral panic
---

I'm yet to read Steven Pinker's new book, _Enlightenment Now_, but it's on my list. In the meantime, I've been watching a lot of his talks on YouTube. This is a good one.  

I don't agree with everything Pinker says, but he makes some salient observations, especially about the news media. Journalists tend to report what goes wrong in the world while ignoring all the things that go right. We get the impression that civilisation is falling apart, when in fact things have never been better. 

In Australia, our current obsession with an "African crime wave" is a good example of this disconnect between perception and reality. Since the problem (if you can call it that) of Melbourne's Sudanese youth gangs first got traction in the media in late 2017, it has exploded into the public consciousness and become a _cause célèbre_ for some of our less enlightened politicians. 

This chart from Google Trends shows you how many Australians searched for the term "African crime" in 2017.

The funny thing is, despite the huge attention this issue has received, the issue itself is virtually non-existent. Sudanese immigrants commit around 1% of all crimes in Victoria. 

It's true that they commit more than their fair share of crimes, relative to the size of their population, but there are many reasons for this. It's not the clear-cut indictment many people make it out to be. 

In any case, no matter how overrepresented Sudanese immigrants may be, they still account for a tiny fraction of the criminal population. The amount of time and energy we spend talking about this issue is grossly disproportionate to the issue itself.     

There's a familiar pattern here. The media picks up on a handful of isolated incidents and gives them front-page coverage. Moral panic ensues. More media coverage follows because it's what people want to read. Then the politicians start talking about it, which generates even more media coverage, and we're off to the races. 

Some Sudanese kids trash a house in Melbourne, and suddenly we're in the grips of an African crime wave. Never mind the fact that your house is far more likely to be trashed by Australian kids. 

A couple of people die in bar brawls in Sydney, and suddenly we face an epidemic of alcohol-fuelled violence. Never mind the fact that both violence and alcohol consumption are at historically low levels. (I wrote about this in the _Sydney Morning Herald_ back in 2015, at the height of our coward-punch hysteria.) 

I don't mean to disrespect the people who fall victim to these crimes or to diminish their suffering. I'm simply pointing out that these people are, thankfully, a tiny minority. These incidents are rare, which is precisely why they shock us. If they happened every day, we wouldn't even notice. 

This is an important fact, but one that we tend to forget. The amount of media coverage an issue receives rarely correlates with the frequency or severity of the issue. Most reporting focuses on the exception to the rule without even acknowledging that the rule exists.

All the more reason, I reckon, to embrace a data-driven model of journalism. Reporting that's grounded in statistics and verifiable facts can provide a powerful antidote to our subjective delusions.
