Christopher Pyne was recently asked if he felt afraid on the streets of Melbourne. His response was "no, why?".

Good question, Christopher. Why should anyone feel afraid in Melbourne? After all, it's one of the safest cities in the world. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, only Tokyo, Singapore, Osaka, and Toronto are less dangerous. 

Contrary to what Peter Dutton would have you believe, Melbourne does not have a problem with law and order. The Victorian Crime Statistics Agency reckons that, in a typical year, 97% of Melburnians will experience zero crime. In city the figure is xx%.

Not only is crime rare in the Victorian capital, but crime committed by immigrants is rarer still. Less than one third of offenders are born outside Australia. And crime committed by a particular subset of immigrants--Sudanese youth, for instance--is so rare as to barely warrant a mention. 

Nonetheless, we mention it plenty. Some of our nation's most prominent voices are doing their best to whip up a moral panic about "African crime". Everyone from the Prime Minister down seems to have jumped on this ugly, xenophobic bandwagon. 

To appreciate how absurd the debate has become, let's take a look at some statistics. Based on data from the past 3 - 5 years, this is what an average year in Melbourne looks like:

- xx people are killed or seriously injured in a car accident
- xx people suffer a heart attack
- xx people commit suicide
- xx people fall to their deaths unintentionally
- xx people overdose on prescription medication

You know how many people get assaulted by a Sudanese youth? 41. In a city of 4.9 million, that's roughly 0.0008 percent of the population. All else being equal, you're a thousand times more likely to do the thing than to have a run-in with your local chapter of the Apex gang. 

Many point out that Sudanese immigrants are overrepresented in the crime statistics. For this analysis, that's beside the point. We're simply comparing the frequencies of one event versus another. Of all the misfortunes that might befall you on a given day in Melbourne, getting attacked by a kid from Africa is one of the least likely. That's true whether the kids are overrepresented or not. 

In a sane world, our fear of an event would correlate with the likelihood of the event happening. But humans are prone to strange phobias and silly ideas. Many of us harbour an irrational fear of flying, even though statistically it's the safest way to travel. Many of us would sooner attempt bungy jumping than public speaking, even though the former is much riskier than the latter.

If we're honest, we'll admit that our current obsession with "African crime" belongs in the same basket of delusional and unjustified beliefs.
